Parallel Testing in Pytest

Parallel testing allows running multiple tests simultaneously,
reducing the total execution time for the test suite.
Pytest achieves parallel testing using the pytest-xdist plugin,
which enables distributing tests across multiple CPUs or hosts.

Features of Parallel Testing in Pytest
	1.	Parallel Workers:
Tests are distributed across multiple processes (workers). Each worker runs independently on a subset of tests.
	2.	Load Balancing:
Use --dist to define how tests are distributed:
	•	load scope: Groups tests by the scope (module/class) and balances them across workers.
	•	loadfile: Distributes tests based on the number of files.
