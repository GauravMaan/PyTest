Logging in Pytest

Logging in Pytest allows capturing and displaying detailed runtime information during test execution.
It helps developers debug issues by recording messages about test behavior,
errors, and other useful runtime data.

Logging Levels

	1.	DEBUG: Detailed information, typically for diagnosing problems.
	2.	INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
	3.	WARNING: Indication of something unexpected but not causing the test to fail.
	4.	ERROR: A serious problem causing a test or functionality to fail.
	5.	CRITICAL: A severe issue indicating the program may be unable to continue.
